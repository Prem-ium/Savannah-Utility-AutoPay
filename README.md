## FAQ

#### How can this repository help Savannah Georgia property owners pay utility bills?

This repository contains a Python script that automates the process of paying utility bills for Savannah properties using Selenium. It can save time and hassle for landlords and business owners who need to pay multiple bills every month.

#### What inspired you to create this script?

I created this script because I was frustrated with the Savannah GA GOV Utility Bill payment website. It was slow, cumbersome, and required me to enter the same information over and over again for each property. I wanted a faster and easier way to pay my utility bills online.
